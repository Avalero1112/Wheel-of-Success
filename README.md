# Wheel-of-Success

This is a game similar tp wheel of fortune where the player selects letters and a phrase is filled in as the player chooses the correct letters. However, there's not much room for error. You have 5 hearts and loose one each time you choose an incorrect letter. Some phrases are longer than others. Refresh the page to load in a different phrase. The next step for this project is to assign a level to each phrase and have them appear one after another as the user correctly guessing them.
